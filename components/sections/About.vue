        Becoming a Senior web developer is one of my dreams. I want to taste everything in programming - from mobile
        apps to desktop games. Something new always piques my interest.
        <br />
        <br />
        I started dreaming about becoming developer since I was a child (around 12 years old), when my friend showed me
        his code of Java or C++, I don't remember. It was code of a simple calculator. What I liked about the code? It
        was a code itself. Numbers, letters, calculations everything was mysterious, hard and yet so interesting. I was
        curious how to create code. I didn't even knew how to start.
        <br />
        <br />
        When did I started learning? It was around 16 years old. I remember myself being on the school stadium and then
        coming back home. I don't remember what happened that I wanted to go home and start learning so badly. I had no
        pc, so I had to learn on the phone. Thank god I had smart phone. Once I downloaded SoloLearn I started learning
        HTML. I fell in love immediately. I learned each day at least 5 hours. This time I knew that I want to become
        developer.
        <br />
        <br />
        My favorite part of web development is creating astonishing designs and create functioning code, that has great
        quality, is working and has no bugs! Also I like working with figma, this is the place, where I can play with my
        creativity.
        <br />
        <br />
        Currently I'm working as a Nuxt.js front-end web developer. My job located in Lithuania, KlaipÄ—da.
